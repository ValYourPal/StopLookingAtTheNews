# StopLookingAtTheNews

## What is this?
This was a HackKU project meant for the health track

## What was the vision?
It would almost be game like. You would visit the site starting with the sounds of collective news anchors across news channels speaking and an
overlap of videos in the background. You have some news channels as draggable items and a trash can. As you drag the news channels to the trash,
the sound gets lower and the videos disappear to reveal a nature scene. 

## What does the news have to do with health?
This was thought of while the pandemic was all anyone would hear about on the news. The health aspect is getting rid of stressful news feeds and be calmed by
the revealed nature. Mental health. It would also act as a reminder that you should probably get outside if you are stressing about something too out of
your control.

## Does it do work?
no.. lol

## Is anyone updating it?
Nope
